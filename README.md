## Prerequisites

 

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

 

- Python 3.6 or higher installed.

- [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) installed.

- Git (optional, for cloning the repository).

 

## Getting Started

 

Follow these steps to get the project up and running.

 

### Clone the Repository

 

```bash

git  clone:https://github.com/ramyamohen/AI_PHASE5.git

```

 

### Install Dependencies

 

Install the required Python packages using pip:

 

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

 

This will install libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib.

 

## Data Preparation

 

1. Download the dataset of house features and prices.

2. Place the dataset file (e.g., `house_data.csv`) in the `data/` directory.

 

## Training the Model

 

To train the house price prediction model, run the following command:

 

```bash

python train_model.py

```

 

This script will preprocess the data, train the machine learning model, and save the trained model to a file.

 

## Testing the Model

 

To test the trained model, run the following command:

 

```bash

python test_model.py

```

 

This script will evaluate the model's performance on a test dataset and display the results.

 

## Evaluation

 

You can find the evaluation metrics and model performance in the `evaluation/` directory.

 

## Predicting New Data

 

To make predictions for new data, use the following script:

 

```bash

python predict.py --input new_data.csv --output predictions.csv

```

 

Replace `new_data.csv` with the CSV file containing the new data you want to predict, and `predictions.csv` with the desired output file.

 

## Customization

 

Feel free to customize the model parameters and preprocessing steps in the code to improve performance.
